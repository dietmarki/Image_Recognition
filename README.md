# Image_Recognition
Image Recognition using Tensorflow...

working in the area of deep learning...

for using the data set (images of vehicles):
download from Kaggle: --> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishabkoul1/vechicle-dataset/data

1. Functional model from Keras → Comparison of models (recognition_vehicle_Funk_01.ipynb)
2. Functional model from Keras with InceptionResNetV2 (best in comparison) (recognition_vehicle_Funk_02.ipynb)
3. Sequential model from Keras → CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) with 2 layers (recognition_vehicle_Seq_01.ipynb)
4. Sequential model from Keras → CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) with 1 layer (recognition_vehicle_Seq_02.ipynb)
